### Project Introdcuction 

1. This Project is made to predict whether a person is having parkinson's disease or not.
2. It is being deployed on  SVM ( support vector machine) classification model with accuracy of 83.4% for test data and 86% for training data.
3. Application is being made using Flask framework , hovered on CICD pipeline with github actionand deployed on Heruko

### Functionality

1. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, muscle control, and balance. It is caused by a loss of dopamine-producing brain cells. Symptoms include tremors, stiffness, slow movements, and difficulty with balance and coordination. There is currently no cure, but medications and therapies can help manage symptoms. (hence early detection is must)

2. This application take multiple inputs ,MDVP:Fo(Hz), MDVP:RAP etc such as  from user regarding movement and voice and predict accordingly
